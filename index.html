        <h2>ZAGREUS</h2>
        <h1>Prince of the Underworld</h1>
        </h1>
        <p>Zagreus has always had a sense that he doesn't belong in the House of Hades. Recently he decided, against his father's will, to escape from the Underworldâ€”no matter how many tries it might take him. He is aided and encouraged in his journey, primarily by his caretaker Nyx and his mentor Achilles. Others outside the House of Hades, such as Sisyphus, Charon, and the Olympians sometimes offer their aid as well.

        <h1>MEGAERA</h1>
        <h1>First of the Furies.</h1>
        <p>After her first defeat, Megaera will join the House of Hades as a character that can be interacted with, though she will still attempt to stop Zagreus from entering Asphodel. She will be found drinking in the House's lounge, but only after a run in which she was defeated; if the lounge has yet to be re-opened, she will instead hang around in the hallway, on the opposite side of Zagreus's door from where Nyx usually stands.
